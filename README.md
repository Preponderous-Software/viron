# Viron

[![CI](https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/Viron/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/Viron/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Viron** is your **foundational spatial simulation service** — the bedrock on which worlds are built.  
It manages **environments**, **grids**, **locations**, and **entities** through a clean REST API so you can skip the boilerplate and focus on *fun, emergent gameplay*.  

It serves as a reusable backend component for simulation-based games, AI experiments, and virtual world applications.

## 🚀 Why Viron Exists

Every game and simulation needs a shared understanding of **where things are** and **how they relate**.  
Without Viron, developers waste weeks reinventing grid systems, spatial queries, and entity placement logic for each new project.  

With Viron:
- Creating an entire environment takes seconds.
- Populating it with entities is a single API call.
- Debugging is instant and visual.
- Multiplayer is a breeze because the world is already consistent for every client.

## 🌍 A Day in the Life with Viron

You sit down with your morning coffee.  
In five minutes, you’ve:
1. **Spawned an entire planet** via `POST /api/v1/environments`.  
2. **Populated it with hundreds of plants and creatures** with one request.  
3. **Watched the simulation come alive** as agents move, interact, and adapt.  
4. **Debugged a gameplay issue** in seconds by querying exactly what’s in a problem area.  

Instead of building coordinate math and entity managers from scratch, you’re free to **design mechanics, test wild ideas, and ship faster**.

## 🎯 Purpose

Viron abstracts away low-level spatial data management so client applications can focus on simulation logic, rendering, and game mechanics.

Core responsibilities:
- Managing hierarchical spatial structures (environments → grids → locations).
- Tracking entity placement and movement.
- Providing clean, testable REST APIs.
- Offering debug tools for rapid development and testing.

## 📦 Features (MVP Scope)

The MVP implements the endpoints defined in `openapi/viron-api.json` and documented in `docs/MVP.md`.

**Environment Management**
- Create, retrieve, update (including renaming), and delete environments.
- Query environments by ID, name, or contained entity.

**Grid Management**
- Retrieve grids by ID or environment.
- Find the grid containing a specific entity.

**Location Management**
- Retrieve locations by ID, grid, or environment.
- Manage entity placement in locations.

**Entity Management**
- Create, retrieve, and delete entities.

**Debug Utilities**
- Generate sample environments, grids, locations, and entities.
- Quickly create a world and place an entity for testing.

> For detailed endpoint definitions and request/response formats, see `docs/MVP.md` and `openapi/viron-api.json`.
